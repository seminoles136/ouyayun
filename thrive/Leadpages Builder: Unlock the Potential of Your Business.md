## Leadpages Features

While Leadpages is often seen as just a landing page builder, its extensive feature set makes it much more than that. This powerful software can elevate your online business to the next level by offering a variety of tools to optimize your marketing efforts.

### 1. High-Converting Templates

Leadpages offers a wide selection of pre-tested, high-converting templates designed to maximize your results. The templates are fully mobile-optimized, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices. Simply use the drag-and-drop editor to customize templates to match your brand and campaign goals. No website? No problem. With Leadpages, you can launch professional landing pages in minutes without any coding required.

### 2. LeadBoxes Pop-Ups

The **LeadBoxes** feature enables you to create pop-ups that can appear anywhere across your website or blog. Whether triggered by a button click, text, or image, these pop-ups are highly effective for capturing leads. Advanced targeting options include:

- Timed pop-ups (e.g., appear after a visitor spends a certain amount of time on your site).
- Exit-intent pop-ups (displayed when a visitor is about to leave the site).

These tools help turn passive visitors into engaged leads, boosting your conversion rates.

### 3. Built-In Ad Creation

Leadpages allows you to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within its platform. This feature is fully automated, pulling content from your landing page and turning it into a compelling ad. With a built-in Facebook pixel, you can easily retarget your audience and analyze ad performance for optimal results.

### 4. A/B Split Testing

Optimize your marketing strategy with Leadpages' powerful **A/B split testing** feature. Test different versions of your landing page side-by-side to determine what works best. This data-driven approach ensures you maximize conversions and stay ahead of the competition.

### 5. Integrations for Maximum Efficiency

Leadpages seamlessly integrates with top marketing tools, making it a versatile addition to your tech stack. Key integrations include:

- **Email Marketing Software**: Automatically add new leads to your email lists and nurture them with automated sequences.
