Product hunters are influencers with large followings on platforms like Product Hunt. When a hunter supports your product, their followers get notified, leading to upvotes and engagement, which helps your product rank among the top five of the day.

**Tips to Find and Engage Product Hunters:**
- **Use Leaderboards:** Find hunters on sites like [Product Hunt Hunters Leaderboard](https://upvote-bell.com/leaderboard).
- **Book Influential Hunters:** Top hunters like Chris Messina may need to be booked months in advance. Use platforms like Twitter and email to reach out.
